            Drafts allow you to write and store in-progress journal entries locally on your device, before sending them to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drafts are ideal if you don't have an internet connection or if you'd like to work on your journal entry at your own pace before submitting it to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read, edit, and delete your drafts at any time. When you're finished with your draft (and when you're online) tap the 'Ready to Submit' button to move your draft into the form to create a new journal entry. You can then prepare your journal entry further (e.g. add a picture) and then submit it to us over the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to remember that drafts are linked to your device, not your user account. This is what allows them to work even when you don't have an internet connection. So please remember that if you share your device with anyone else then they'll be able to read, edit, and delete your drafts.
        </p>
